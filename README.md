Data science excersice predicting identity fraud on credit cards.
03/04/2022
I started with a simple EDA on our database then we tried to predict using a logistic regression without good result predicting the fraud. With help of the confussion matrix I was able to observed that only 76 cases were predicted correctly on fraud class, that is 56.29% of model precision.
We are calculating the model sensitivity and F1-Score which for fraud are more important metrics.
F1- Score reprsents a more balanced result as it is the harmonic mean between Precision and Recall. Sensitivity is more important in the sense that we are more interested in identifying fraud than than identifying legitimate customers.
